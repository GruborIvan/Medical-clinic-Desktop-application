Application works because it has TrustServerCertificate=True in the connection string.

----------------
Quick Fix (for testing/development only)
Add TrustServerCertificate=True to your SSMS connection:

In SSMS connection dialog, click "Options >>"

Go to the "Additional Connection Parameters" tab

Add: TrustServerCertificate=True
